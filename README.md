# cafe_website

## Why ? 

This is a small website that I copied from a figma for Advanced Web Programming in Concordia. 
link to the original figma: https://www.figma.com/file/kkbRFUeUAljzsTcJr209ZZ/Cafe-Street---E-Commerce-Landing-Page-(Community)?node-id=6%3A48

back-end available at : https://github.com/Essilu/coffee_website_api
(You need the back end to run the site properly)
